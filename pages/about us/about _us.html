        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>So, it goes like this, I was going for a ride on my bike.
            It was a brand new bike from my mother. For my birthday or something.
            Anyway, I was riding, right? And I was pedaling really fast and. . . . . . .
            I came up to this giant hill. It was big ….really big, so, yeah,
            I started pedaling up it but I really had to work it.
            Unfortunately as I got the top, so close to the top that I only had one more pedal to go and………it stalled.
            I couldn’t pedal; I didn’t go anywhere. Then I started going backwards. Down the giant hill. I couldn’t
            control it.
            I was building up speed really fast. I tried to keep it steady but I spun out, the bike flipped me off.
            was flying through the air at full speed, my vision was blurred. Then I hit the ground like a sack of
            potatoes.
            After that I had no idea what happened to me.
            I blacked out.
            Now where am I? I can’t move, my bones are sore. I opened my eyes. I was in serious pain.
            I looked around. The cannibals were swarming. They ate me. I woke up. Just a dream, a terrible
            dream.
            But I’m still a bit sore, I feel broken, disgusting. Oh relief. HOSPITAL said the sign on the wall.</p>
